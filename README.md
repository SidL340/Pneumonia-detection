##Project Overview
Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection affecting millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial for effective treatment and patient outcomes. This project leverages deep learning to create an automated pneumonia detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze chest X-ray images. By training a CNN on labeled images, this model is capable of classifying X-rays into two categories: normal (healthy) and pneumonia-affected.

This repository contains the code, dataset handling, model training, evaluation, and a Python app for deploying the model to make predictions on new X-ray images.

##Problem Statement
Pneumonia remains a major global health issue, with millions of cases annually and significant mortality rates. Diagnosing pneumonia through chest X-rays can be challenging due to subtle signs that may be difficult for the human eye to detect. Automating the detection process using deep learning can improve diagnostic accuracy and provide a valuable tool to assist healthcare professionals in identifying pneumonia cases efficiently and accurately.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images labeled as either normal (healthy) or pneumonia-affected. The images are resized to 224x224 pixels for input into the CNN model. We perform data preprocessing and data augmentation (such as flipping and rotation) to improve the model’s performance and robustness.

The dataset can be accessed on Kaggle or from any public X-ray dataset source.

##Methodology
This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The methodology consists of the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and applying data augmentation.
Model Architecture: Building a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification.
Model Training: Using binary cross-entropy as the loss function, with the Adam optimizer, to train the model on the pneumonia dataset.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deployment: The trained model is deployed in a Python application for real-time predictions on new X-ray images.

Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need the following:

Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Flask (for deployment)
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/pneumonia-detection.git
cd pneumonia-detection
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download and prepare the dataset from Kaggle. Place the images in a folder named data within the project directory.

Start the training script (optional if pre-trained model is included):

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Usage
Training the Model: To train the model from scratch, run:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will preprocess the images, build the model, and train it on the dataset.

Testing the Model: Evaluate the trained model on the test set by running:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
Making Predictions: Use the deployment app to upload an X-ray image and get predictions in real time:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to upload an image and view the result.

Model Deployment
The trained model is deployed using a Python application powered by Flask. This app accepts X-ray images, preprocesses them, and feeds them into the model to predict whether the image shows a healthy lung or pneumonia.

To start the app, use:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
For a live demo, open the browser and go to http://localhost:5000 where you can upload images and get predictions.

Results
The model achieved high accuracy and recall on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in diagnosing pneumonia. Key metrics include:

Accuracy: X%
Precision: Y%
Recall: Z%
F1 Score: W%
(Add a table or plot here to show the metrics if possible)

Future Work
Potential improvements and extensions for this project include:

Expanding the Dataset: Increasing the dataset size to include more diverse sources.
Multiclass Classification: Adding more classes, such as distinguishing between viral, bacterial, and fungal pneumonia.
Transfer Learning: Utilizing pretrained models like ResNet or DenseNet to potentially improve performance.
User Interface Improvements: Building a more user-friendly interface for real-world clinical use.
